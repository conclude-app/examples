# Conclude Contact Form Example

This example implements a simple webform where visitors can send a message directly to a
Slack workspace using a Conclude app with a web connector.

See the [developer's guide](https://conclude.app/doc/developer/web-connector) for a
walk-through on how to connect the web form to Slack.

This code is also available as an interactive demo on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/concludeapp/pen/abBgjyR).

The javascript code that submits the form, is available as
- https://conclude.app/js/activityform-min.js
- https://conclude.app/js/activityform.js
- js/activityform.js in this repository.

Feel free to fork the html/css/js code in this repository and use it in your own projects (MIT license).
